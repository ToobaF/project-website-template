Welcome to my blog! This is where you can learn any type of art all the way from making realistic drawings to learning how to write in different styles. Here I have uploaded a 
video to each category along with a detailed description to what is going on and the steps within the process. If there is something which can be done in multiple ways I will try
to show as many posssibilites as I can so there is something for everyone.
